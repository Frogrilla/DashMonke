Dash around with a button of your choice with an incredibly customizable dash. </br>
The mod only works in modded lobbies - using it elsewhere is **cheating**.

There are some differnces to the old DashMonke mods:
- Dashes can now only be performed when your hands are not touching anything
- Hitting colliders with your hands will prematurely end a dash
- Now only works in modded lobbies

# Config settings 

## Dash
**Power:**
- Speed applied during dash
- Capped in a certain way as to not allow long powerful dashes

**EndPower:**
- Speed applied at the end of the dash
- Also capped to not allow too powerful dashes

**Duration:**
- Length of the dash

**Controlled:**
- If this is enabled, the dash direction will update during the dash

**UseCancel:**
- When enabled, you will be able to press the dash button again to cancel mid dash

**PowerMultiplier:**
- Multiplies your speed before your dash by the multiplier and adds it to the value of Power to calculate the dash speed

**EndMultiplier:**
- Same as PowerMultiplier but for EndPower

**Wait:**
- If this number is above 2, instead of being able to dash again once touching something with your hands you have to wait out a timer before you can dash again
- When in no gravity this number will be bumped up to 8 if it is below 8 seconds already
